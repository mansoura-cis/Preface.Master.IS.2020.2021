- The Cloud is Ubiqutous (The Resourses found in every where)
- These are virtual Resoures
- Virtualy unlimited computational capabilities
- Unlimited storage capabilities
- The internet is a service delivery channel
- Used to manage Big Data


# CloudIOT Architecture

- Application Layer : provides the interfaces of different services
- Network Layer to transfer the collection of data via internet cloud
- Sensing Layer (perception layer) used to define objects and collection data from real world
