    "> A NoSQL (originally referring to \"non-SQL\" or \"non-relational\") database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but the name \"NoSQL\" was only coined in the early 21st century, triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- NoSQL systems are also sometimes called \"Not only SQL\" to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages or sit alongside SQL databases in polyglot-persistent architectures.\n",

    "## Polyglot Presistance Architecture \n",
    "> is a term that refers to using multiple data storage technologies for varying data storage needs across an application or within smaller components of an applicati\n",
    "on. Such varying data storage needs could arise in both the cases, i.e. an enterprise with multiple applications or singular components of an application needing to store data differently.\n",

    "\n",
    "- __Motivations__ for this approach include:\n",
    "  - simplicity of design, simpler \"horizontal\" scaling to clusters of machines (which is a problem for relational databases)\n",
    "  ![](./PICS/horizontal-scaling.png)\n",
    "  - finer control over availability and limiting the object-relational impedance mismatch.\n",
    "  ![](./PICS/1.png)\n",
    "  - The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. key–value pair, wide column, graph, or document) are different from those used by default in relational databases making some operations faster in NoSQL.\n",
    "  ![](./PICS/types-of-nosql-datastores.png)\n",
    "  - The particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve. Sometimes the data structures used by NoSQL databases are also viewed as \"more flexible\" than relational database tables.\n",

    "- Availability: Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write\n",

    "  - On the completion of a transaction, the database is structurally sound.\n",

    "  - Transactions do not contend with one another. Contentious access to data is moderated by the database so that transactions appear to run sequentially.\n",

    "  - The database appears to work most of the time.\n",

Nakamoto was active in the development of bitcoin up until December 2010.[7] Many people have claimed, or have been claimed, to be Satoshi Nakamoto."
